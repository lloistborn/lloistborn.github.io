## Reliability
Regarding system reliability, everyone has an intuitive idea about what it means.

Essentially, a reliable system is a system that can seamlessly run even when part of its system is in a fault state.
When the system can handle such a case, we call it _fault-tolerant_ or _resilient_ system.

Now, of course, no system can cope with any possible faults. 
So, it makes sense to discuss only the type of faults that we can handle.

A _fault-tolerant system_ typically will prevent a fault from spreading and causing failure.
