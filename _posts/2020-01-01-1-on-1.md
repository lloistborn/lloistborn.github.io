# Book a free 1-on-1 Session with Me

Welcome! I'm Faisal Morensya, a Software Engineer based in Dubai.

Here's a little bit about me ‚Äì outside of being a professional in my field.

## A Bit of Fun!
- **Sports Fanatic**: Whether it's playing, watching, or discussing, sports are a big part of my life. You might find me cheering loudly for my favorite teams or out on the field giving my all!
- **Globe-Trotter**: I've got a serious case of wanderlust. From the bustling streets of Tokyo to the serene beaches of Bali, I love exploring new places and soaking in different cultures.
- **Dota Devotee**: In the world of gaming, Dota is my battlefield. Strategizing, teaming up, and facing challenges ‚Äì it's not just a game; it's a test of skills and wits!
- **Career Growth Enthusiast**: I'm passionate about personal and professional growth. I believe there's always room to learn more, do better, and help others along their career paths.
